# King Fred the Fearless

Once upon a time, there was a tiny country called Cornucopia, which had been ruled for centuries by a long line of fair-haired kings. The king at the time of which I write was called King Fred the Fearless. He’d announced the ‘Fearless’ bit himself.

## Character traits

* Lovely yellow curls
* fine sweeping moustaches
* looked magnificent in his tight breeches, velvet doublets, and ruffled shirts

> I do treat them well, don’t I?
> And after all, chaps, I’ve got to look my blasted best today, haven’t I? 
> You know how dressy the King of Pluritania always is!
